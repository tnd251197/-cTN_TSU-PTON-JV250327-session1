    <p style="color: blue;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage</p>
    <div class="css" >With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how element are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be usedm different displays for different devices screen sizes, and much more! </div>
    <div class="tip"> <span>Tip:</span> The word <span>cascading</span> means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply toall children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue" all heading, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)! </div>
